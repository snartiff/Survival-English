Goal: The purpose of this app is to showcase my UI/UX development skills with React. 
All data consists of Javascript objects and for now there is no back-end.

Description: This is an educational app for English Language Learners who want to
learn business English. The goal is for each "level" to be modeled after WIDA ELL standards. 

Process:
Start building level-by-level. Complete Levels 1 and Level 2 first. Add lesson objectives 
and 'cheat' sheet so users can easily show/hide tips. Complete levels 3-5 next. 
Once my first lesson is complete, I will add additional lessons.

Structure

Lesson:
Each Lesson component will consist of 5 different Prompt components. Each lesson will have 
a different language objective.

Prompt:
Each Prompt component will have its own UI, designed specifically for that level (1-5).

Data:
Data.js is the source of all Data used in this application. Each Prompt will have a separate
function that populates its data.
